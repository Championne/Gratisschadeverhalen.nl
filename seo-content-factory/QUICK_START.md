# SEO Factory - Quick Start Guide

## To Start Working on SEO Content:

Just say one of these commands:
- "Work on SEO"
- "Continue SEO factory"
- "Build SEO pages"
- "Create SEO content"

---

## What Happens:

1. Claude reads MASTER_SEO_PLAN.md
2. Claude spawns 4 sub-agents in parallel
3. Sub-agents create pages/articles
4. Progress is updated
5. Next batch is spawned
6. Repeats until all done

---

## Key Files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `MASTER_SEO_PLAN.md` | Full plan + progress tracking |
| `AUTONOMOUS_WORK.md` | How to spawn sub-agents |
| `COMPETITOR_KEYWORDS.md` | SEO keywords to use |
| `QUICK_START.md` | This file |

---

## Progress Check:

Look at MASTER_SEO_PLAN.md → "Progress Tracking" section

- ⏳ TODO = Not started
- 🔄 In Progress = Being worked on
- ✅ DONE = Completed

---

## Current Priorities:

### Pages to Create:
1. /materiele-schade/
2. /hoe-werkt-het/
3. /waarborgfonds/
4. /artikel-185-wvw/
5. /schade-expert/
6. /downloads/

### Then:
- 40 blog articles (batches of 4)
- 3 research reports

---

## Business Rules (CRITICAL):

**Always include in sub-agent prompts:**

✅ We handle: materiële autoschade, gratis verhaalservice, dashboard, expertise, Waarborgfonds
❌ We DON'T handle: lease, loonregres, opstal/inboedel, traumabegeleiding, direct letselschade

**Letselschade:** Only refer to "partner Unitas Letselschade"

---

## That's it! Just say "Work on SEO" to start.
